    	////////// PROJECT RULES //////////
    	// 30 seconds for initial move, 2 seconds for subsequent moves
    	// Code must be less than 10mb
    	// Can only use 500mb of ram
    	//		Run JVM with “-Xms520m -Xmx520m” to ensure this
    	// Can multithread, but only one processor 
    	//		Must end threads on turn completion
    	// Allowed to read files, not allowed to write them
    	// Possible to have infinite moves
    	//		This is where you pick up and sow seeds indefinitely within a turn
    	//		Can only have up to 200 of these relays
    	//		If 3 times of more than 200, automatic game loss
    	//		Apparently can check this by running move on copy of board state
    	//			HusBoardState has invalid move checkers
    	// Cannot use external libraries (must make all my own code)
    	//		TODO check to see if tree libraries are acceptable 
    	// Make sure I document well
    	
    	////////// INITIAL THOUGHTS //////////
    	// Should have each gameplay type as a separate package
    	// i.e. if I use minimax, should have a minimax package

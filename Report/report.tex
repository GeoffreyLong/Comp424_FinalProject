%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% REQUIREMENTS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%The suggested length is between 4 and 5 pages (at âˆ¼300 words per page), but the most important constraint is that the report be clear and concise. The report must include the following required components:
%1. An explanation of how your program works, and a motivation for your approach.
%2. A brief description of the theoretical basis of the approach (about a half-page in most cases); references to the text of other documents, such as the textbook, are appropriate but not absolutely necessary. I you use algorithms from other sources, briefly describe the algorithm and be sure to cite your source.
%3. A summary of the advantages and disadvantages of your approach, expected failure modes, or weaknesses of your program.
%4. If you tried other approaches during the course of the project, summarize them briefly and discuss how they compared to your final approach.
%5. A brief description (max. half page) of how you would go about improving your player (e.g. by introducing other AI techniques, changing internal representation etc.).
